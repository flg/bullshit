# bullshit

Display a "bullshit" stamp sign overlay at current mouse position for a configurable amount of time.
One can also choose different images: bullet impacts, "refused by QA" stamp.

On Linux, you can have fun with xbindkeys. Install it, edit the configuration file as:

    "cd /path/to/bullshit/ && ./bullshit.py"
        control + b:1

Run xbindkeys. Now, "control + mouse click" should display the "bullshit" stamp.

Use it well.
